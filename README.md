The Forest of Aetheria

Developed by Justin Mullins

This is a text adventure game I made using JavaScript.
I made this game to practice my coding skills and using JavaScript for game design.



You wander through a forest trying to solve puzzles and unlock the secrets hidden deep within.

The commands the game understands so far are: north, east, south, west, use <item name>, take <item name>, drop <item name>, talk

I have plans to add more quest, expand the world, and change the user input system from text based to a point and click system.
